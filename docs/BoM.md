# BoM (Bill of Material) WIP

As always this list is intended as a helpful reference but it may not be entirely accurate or complete. Quantities can vary depending on specific build choices, mistakes during assembly, or future modifications, so it is always a good idea to order a few extra components where possible to avoid delays. If you come across any missing parts or notice anything that seems incorrect, please do not hesitate to let us know so we can update the list for everyoneâ€™s benefit.
